#Push the application
#To trigger the pipeline, push the master branch to the remote as follows:

git push -u origin master

#The pipeline will pull the code, build the docker image, push it to ECR, and deploy it to your ECS cluster. This will take a few minutes. You can monitor the pipeline in the AWS CodePipeline console.


#Test the application
#From the output of the Terraform build, note the Terraform output alb_address.

cd ../terraform
export tf_alb_address=$(terraform output alb_address)
echo $tf_alb_address
Use this in your browser to access and test the application.


#Push a change through the pipeline and re-test
#The pipeline can now be used to deploy any changes to the application.

#You can try this out by changing the welcome message as follows:

cd ../petclinic
vi src/main/resources/messages/messages.properties
#Change the value for the welcome string, for example, to "Hello".

#Commit the change:

git add .
git commit -m "Changed welcome string"

#Push the change to trigger pipeline:

git push origin master

#As before, you can use the console to observe the progression of the change through the pipeline. Once done, verify that the application is working with the modified welcome message.
